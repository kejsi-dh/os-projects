# Operating Systems Concepts' Projects
Operating Systems Projects for my Bachelor course, based on projects from the "Operating Systems Concepts" 9th edition book. Language used: Albanian. Finished and handed in 2022.

### Description of each Problem:
In the folder `linked-lists` is the Part 2 of the project that reads as follows:
* In the module entry point, create a linked list containing five struct birthday elements. Traverse the linked list   and output its contents to the kernel log buffer. Invoke the dmesg command to ensure the list is properly constructed once the kernel module has been loaded.
* In the module exit point, delete the elements from the linked   list and return the free memory back to the kernel. Again, invoke the dmesg command to check that the list has been removed once the kernel module has been unloaded.
